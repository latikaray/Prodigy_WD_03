# PRODIGY_WD_03: Responsive Tic Tac Toe Web Application

Welcome to the **PRODIGY_WD_03** repository! As part of my web development internship, I've built a responsive Tic Tac Toe web application with interactive features. Here's what you'll find:

1. **Game Modes:**
   - **Multiple Players:** Challenge your friends! Play against each other on the same device.

2. **User Experience:**
   - The Awesome Winner Declared.
   - Neither Conquered nor Defeated, It's a DRAW!
   - Play again option after a game ends.

3. **Tech Stack:**
   - HTML: The structure of the game board.
   - CSS: Styling for a sleek interface.
   - JavaScript: Logic for game mechanics.
